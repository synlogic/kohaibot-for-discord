Wishing you all the best.
For glory and honor! Huzzah comrades!
It's past my bedtime. Please don't tell my mommy.
Mommy says people my age shouldn't suck their thumbs.
Well played. I salute you all.
Ah shucks... you guys are the best!
Great game, everyone!
I could really use a hug right now
I'm trying to be a nicer person. It's hard, but I'm trying, guys.
I'm wrestling with some insecurity issues in my life but thank you all for playing with me.
