Cloud10 Mee6#4876 said: Hey! synlogic is now live on https://www.twitch.tv/synlogic ! Go check it out!
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: I miss you too!
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Also, just got on PTR and tested Ana. Total shit, not worth using at all now.
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: The PTR forums are an intersting mix of "it's ok" to "fuck you jeff"
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: So I went to the forums to maybe bitch. Don't need to, not a single damn piece of good feedback. Literally everything on the nerf is complaints
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: And by "it's ok" I mean "fuck you blizzard"
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: She can't stay alive though or heal anything well really. She is a high skill cap with no payoff now.
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: "might as well just remove her from the game"
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: But odds are they are reverting it at least a little.
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: If it gets pushed to live, I will probably not play a single game as a team with her on it, just saying. It is way to big of a nerf. The nerf to biotic damage is fine, IDC. The nerf to biotic heal is garbage and shouldn't change at all. If they nerf her gun, they need to do it by 10, not 20.
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: hello, if they did it by 10, she still can't 3 shot
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: they literally reduced her healing by 50 every 12 seconds
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Yup, and it is making her die to flankers almost instantly.
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: if you're gonna bitch then bitch about the actual changes
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Also, over the course of an entire comp game, it adds up
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: fuck off
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: They're trying to turn ana into mercy
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: JK
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: Ana will be just another heal bot
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: So I shouldn't talk about soon to come out things? or PTR? are you serious? why are you acting like a child?
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: you are bitching about shit that isn't even valid
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: Geez, calm down
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: He can have an opinion too
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: Just like you
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: If people don't bitch then it gets released... Do you know what PTR is for? feedback and testing...
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: i'm not talking about the nerf as a whole
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Just like i wasn't directing shit at you specifically. I said my thoughts on something after playing it. So seriously, IDC what you think now as you said fuck off to me for voicing my opinion. Grow the fuck up.
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: well, i haven't played with you in 2 goddamn months and you're getting a replacement anyway
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: why the fuck am i here
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/5y4exb/with_these_changes_ana_is_now_the_weakest_hero_in/
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: ok then.
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: Check out the graphs for dmg and healing for Ana in comparison to other supporst
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: Honestly they shouldn't market her as a dps-heals hybrid if she's going to spend most of her time just healing her team while being low hp in the back
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: since when did they do that?
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: She's a sniper
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: I mean...
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Since her pre release...
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: ???
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: That was the point of her gun functioning as damage and heals
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: fuck it, i'm not gonna argue
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: They specifically said that before release
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: that doesn't mean she's a dps hybrid, that means lucio is a dps by the same standards of a gun that heals and damages
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: It doesn't heal by shooting
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: they gave her the sleep dart as an escape option so she didn't have to deal with 1v1 scenarios and she could run away
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: Lucio's cabbage gun doesn't heal by shooting
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: And also has small dps
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: and that is what makes ana unique
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: And also pretty large travel time
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: she shoots to heals
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: that was the point of her sniper
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: a long range healer
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: she could snipe but it wasn't meant to be as effective as it is
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: but they market her as hitscan when scoped
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: Market her?
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: hitscan means no travel time
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: not dps
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: ana did less damage at launch
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: they increased he firing speed and magazine capacity
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: less damage over time
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: See, that's the other ting
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: the fact that jar does less and she does less damage and less healing she has to reload MORE
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: which means more downtime
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: Wait
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: I just read the other thing
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: I remember very clearly people being excited for a dps/support hybrid
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: I mean... I can't be alone in that
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: i remember at launch that people were mad at shitty anas playing as dps
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: That is every game with a bad ana at all
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: High skill cap should have a high reward
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: *hybrid*
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: *do both*
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: and that reward has been lessened as a dps yet stays nearly the same as a healer
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: No
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: It's a 25% nerf to her heals
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: Assuming you hit *all* your shots
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: plus you have no heals for yourself
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: where is that number coming from?
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: lemme find the thread
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Well the number and charts and all the forums disagree.
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Also, even at pre nerf, she did less damage than Zen both with or without discord
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Does*
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: and zen does 30 hps
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Yes, worse heals, but ehj
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: 50 HP + 140.625 for 190.625 of nade plus one second healing
down from the current 240.625 which is a 21% decrease from Live and down from 287.5 of 1.6 which is a 34% drop from 1.6.
She also just lost 25% of her damage from her rifle, 15% of her damage from her combo, and half of her self sustain.
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: 50 + 112 + 112 + 112 + 112 + 112 = 610
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: currently it is 660
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: this is if you grenade an ally then shoot them for the duration
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: that is not 25% less healing
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: care to fix my math?
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: i'm failing math so feel free to fix it
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: that's rounding down the .5s btw
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: i'm not saying the nerf is good, i think she needs a small nerf now but you guys are not making sense and it's all just hyperbole
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: So... honestly I think I'm done talking to you for the night
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: You're obviously pissed at someone or something because you're kind of attacking us for having a differing opinion than you
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: I'll try to pick up this conversation again tomorrow after we've all had some cool off time
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: I think that would probably be for th best
Cloud10 kittens#7520 said: Have a good night everyone
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: Is the math wrong though? You didn't answer...
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: So your answer to people wanting to stop fighting is to call them back into the fight Nat?
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: It's not about you fighting
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: No, but it is, she said she was done, and you called on her again
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: It's about you glossing over the fact that he's right
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: nothing personal
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Well with the math, it is at least a 21% decrease
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Maybe Ican misspoke. But also, where are the 112's coming from? there is no heal she does that is 112?
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: 112.5
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: 75 heals with th 50% heal buff
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: So you are saying 2 shots a second and adding them together?
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: 7.5% decrease btw
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: 2 shots a second? it's a 4 second buff
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Yeah, I am just seeing what your exact number are
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: it may be 1 less shot, i'd need to do a test for that
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: but it's still nowhere near 21%
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmWVboUC2t0&feature=youtu.be
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: it's correct, ana shoots 1.25 rounds per second
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: start at 3:07
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: I will honestly say I did NOT do all the math myself as it is late and I didn't care that much while tired
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: But if THEIR math is right...
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: there's no way it is
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: nothing would come to 140
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: and i have no idea how they got decimals that specific
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: actually, it is right with my rough calculation
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Actually no, his math is right. ptr his numbers are right, and live and 1.5 his math is right, just checked it
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: it's without any context though and is close to meaningless in a match
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: But What Ican stated and quoted is right, and Nat asked.
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: 1 second burst potential is what Ican said
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: we're both right, mine is just the full goddamn equation
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: It checks out
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Well, I am answering specifically what Nat asked.
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: he asked if my math was right
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: Both check out, thanks for the info guys.
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: I'm bad at math so I wanted to know
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: over the course of 1 second she is 21% less effective at potentially saving a team mate
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Nat, question, what was the 7.5% decrease you brought up? Interested
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: it's more than any other healer can do
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: but it's 21% less
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: 660 to 610 is a 7.5 decrease
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: over the duration of the buff it is only 7.5% less
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: So over the whole thing, and assuming you can hit every shot. Correct
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Plus no reloads
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: yes
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: well
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: assuming you have full ammo
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: 5 shots is half a clip and on a tank where you would need to heal 600+ health that will be no issue
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: ana has barely been touched in terms of healing
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Then yes, both in THAT part of the stupid argument, were right
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: Anyway, good night guys.
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Night
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: you can't say she is a useless no potential healer
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: look at the forums and the majority of backlash. All it is is backlash. They over corrected which was my main point, and she is close to useless, all she was was burst heals. Mercy does better consistent.
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: none of that has changed
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: If she can't burst save, she has no room on a team really other than nano,
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: she can though
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: she is still better at it than any other character
Cloud10 AGnatNamedNat#2804 said: with her darts
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: other than fucking zen ult
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Better, sure, but I never said I disliked the heals only, it's that they are Nerfing EVERYTHING at the same time
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: okay then don't claim hyperbolic shit about her heals
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Umm, what?
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Exagerating i assume you mean? Which I didn't, as I didn't claim much of anything on heals anitially, and the only thing I defended was fact and math... sooo yeah
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: "She can't stay alive though or heal anything well really. She is a high skill cap with no payoff now."
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: dismissing the first point since i have no interest in debating that nerf
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: a 21% decrease out of context over the course of a second is close to irrelevant and a 7.5% less healing over all doesn't mean she can't heal anything well
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Fair, I did say that, this whole argument is so dumb I forgot about that
Cloud10 frogman666#9245 said: Use her then talk
Cloud10 i have the potential to consume#3352 said: i fucking can't
